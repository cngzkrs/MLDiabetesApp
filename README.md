# Microsoft.ML.ModelBuilder
This all documents, notes and all codes inspired from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/ml-dotnet/get-started-tutorial/intro
I developed the codes step by step following the course.

"Install the ML.NET Model Builder extension for Visual Studio, then train and use your first machine learning model with ML.NET."  
  
For dataset, I used "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
